# SQL-Covid-Data-Analysis

# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis of COVID-19 data using advanced SQL queries. The analyses focus on global and country-specific statistics, including case totals, deaths, recoveries, and testing rates.

## Files Included
- **covid_analysis.sql**: Contains SQL queries for extracting comprehensive insights from the COVID-19 dataset.
- **covid_data.csv**: The raw dataset used for the analysis. Ensure that this file is imported into your SQL database before running the queries.

## SQL Queries Description
1. **Global Overview**: Calculates the global total number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries.
2. **Country-wise Analysis**: Identifies the top 10 countries with the highest number of cases and provides the case-fatality rate and recovery rate.
3. **Testing Analysis**: Ranks countries based on their testing rates per million population.

## Usage
To use the SQL queries provided, import your COVID-19 dataset into an SQL-compatible database system like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite. Execute the queries in the SQL file to retrieve the data.
